The Current Directory

2. It is very important not to get lost! You must try to remember which directory you are in.
If you forget, you can use a special command called pwd

Home Directory

1. When you open the Terminal you are in your HOME DIRECTORY
usually you don't want to store files directly in here
Listing Directory Contents
1.when you type ls ("list") it shows the contents of the current directory

Making a directory

1.when you type mkdir ("make dir") it creates a new SUBDIRECTORY inside the current directory
code - mkdir file name (code)

Changing directories

1.cd ("change dir") moves you into a different directory
For example, cd code would move you into a directory named code
2.If you ever get lost, type cd all on its own and press the return key. 
This will send you back to your home directory.
